Math classes is a library of abstract interfaces for mathematical
structures, such as:

*  Algebraic hierarchy (groups, rings, fields, …)
*  Relations, orders, …
*  Categories, functors, universal algebra, …
*  Numbers: N, Z, Q, …
*  Operations, (shift, power, abs, …)

It is heavily based on Coq’s new type classes in order to provide:
structure inference, multiple inheritance/sharing, convenient
algebraic manipulation (e.g. rewriting) and idiomatic use of
notations.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Math Classes
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-math-classes
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/math-classes.git
cd math-classes
./configure.sh
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```


## Directory structure

### categories/
Proofs that certain structures form categories.

### functors/

### interfaces/
Definitions of abstract interfaces/structures.

### implementations/
Definitions of concrete data structures and algorithms, and proofs that they are instances of certain structures (i.e. implement certain interfaces).

### misc/
Miscellaneous things.

### orders/
Theory about orders on different structures.

### quote/
Prototype implementation of type class based quoting. To be integrated.

### theory/
Proofs of properties of structures.

### varieties/
Proofs that certain structures are varieties, and translation to/from type classes dedicated to these structures (defined in interfaces/).

The reason we treat categories and varieties differently from other structures
(like groups and rings) is that they are like meta-interfaces whose implementations
are not concrete data structures and algorithms but are themselves abstract structures.

To be able to distinguish the various arrows, we recommend using a variable width font.
